<h1 id="energy-monitor-setup">Energy Monitor Setup</h1>

<p>This monitoring system is current transformation (<code class="highlighter-rouge">CT</code>) clamp based implementation. CT technology is based on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Faraday</code> (Feh.ruh.dei) low. (Same theory behind the generator)</p>

<h2 id="what-have-i-used-in-this-setup">What have I used in this setup</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- CircuitSetUp
    - Open source (Crowd funded June 2019)
    - Number of communication protocols 
        i) Wifi 
        ii) 3G 
        iii) BLE
        iv) LoRa (Low powered wide area network)

    - Accuracy and the ability to measure mA level usages
        - Used one of the powerful energy metering chic is made by Microchip now Atmel

- ESP32 As the communicator between the chip and the server

- Home Assistant (Data storage and visualizer)
    - Open source
    - Very powerful
        - Visualization
            i) Grafana
            ii) InfluxDB

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- ML model to read the energy signature and identify individual equipments
    EX: Use cases: Home energy report will be more accurate

- Predictive Analytics to provide equipment working condition to the customers
    Ex: 
    * Identify issues earlier and save unnecessary expensive service and replacement cost
    * Promote equipment better serve individual customer usage and matches the home energy profile (Cost efficiency of going for most energy efficient vs what best for them based on the usage)
